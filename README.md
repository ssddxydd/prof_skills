# prof_skills
Repository of scripts and some data from the Professional skills module in Physics. Aim of the project is to identify an active area of Physics research, conduct an investigation in to the topic and, as a group present your solution to the problem. The topic of our group was Atmospheric seeing i.e. the disruption of starlight by the atmosphere. The scripts contained here aim to simulate the atmospheric seeing and try to describe the effect using simple models. The end ideal end goal would be to use the completed simulation in testing solutions to atmospheric seeing.
